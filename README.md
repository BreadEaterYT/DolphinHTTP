# DolphinHTTP
DolphinHTTP is a webserver designed to be simple and used for development, maybe will be redesigned for production use too.

### Features

- Custom API routes using .js files (coming soon)
- Built-in support for MySQL and SQLite (coming soon)
- Built-in HTTP client, Java Socket Server and WebSocket Server (coming soon)

### Requirements

### How to install and use

1. download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/BreadEaterYT/DolphinHTTP/releases) on GitHub or clone it and compile it with the following command:
~~~bash
mvn install
~~~
2. move the downloaded / compiled jar file to a folder
3. open a terminal and execute the following command:
~~~bash
java -jar DolphinHTTP.jar --port 80
~~~

if you wish to use another port than 80 then use the --port argument, else if you use 80 you can remove it, but you'll need to run it with admin privileges, aka root if you're under linux
